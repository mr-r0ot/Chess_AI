# Chess AI with Keras and Stockfish

Welcome to the Chess AI project! This project combines the power of Keras for machine learning with the Stockfish chess engine to create a challenging and interactive chess experience. Play against a simple AI, or let two AIs battle it out!

## Features

- **Play against a Keras-based AI**: Experience a simple AI opponent that uses random moves.
- **Play against Stockfish**: Choose from various difficulty levels to challenge the powerful Stockfish engine.
- **Observe AI vs AI matches**: Watch two AIs compete against each other!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `chess`, `numpy`, `keras`
- [Download Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/download/): You need to download the Stockfish ZIP file and extract it. Place the extracted folder alongside this script.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install chess numpy keras
   ```
3. Download the Stockfish engine from [here](https://stockfishchess.org/download/).
4. Extract the ZIP file and place the folder in the same directory as this script.

## Usage

Run the script and choose an option from the menu:

1. **Play with Keras AI (Easy)**
2. **Play with EvilCHESS AI (Various Difficulty Levels)**
3. **See Play 2 AI**

Follow the prompts to enter your moves and enjoy the game!

## How to Play

1. **Choose your opponent**: Select whether you want to play against the Keras-based AI or the Stockfish engine.
2. **Make your move**: Enter your move in UCI format (e.g., `e2e4`).
3. **Watch the AI play**: If you're playing against Stockfish, the AI will respond based on the chosen difficulty level.
